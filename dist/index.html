                    Wilf is very creative, reliable and is able to use his own initiative to tackle his workload.<br>
                    This was demonstrated during his internship where he was able to follow a given brief, make suggestions on creatives and worked collaboratively with a fellow intern to carry out various filming and independently edit footage for the intended videos.<br>
                    I would happily work with Wilf again and know heâ€™ll be a great asset to his future employers.

                    Hillside commissioned Wilf to film video content for a client. He took the time to understand the project and what the end product was meant to be. On the day, he was prepared and easy to work with, bringing an attention to detail and aim for perfection that was invaluable.<br>
                    The quality of the video was exactly what we were looking for and his expertise in post-production was vital in helping complete the project.

                    We really enjoyed working with Wilf both as a professional and a creative, he captured innovative shots that showed our work in a new light and sensitively approached the varying environments.
